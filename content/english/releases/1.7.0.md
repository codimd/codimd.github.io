We have renamed to HedgeDoc! ðŸŽ‰   
Many thanks to [Ã‰ric Gaspar](https://github.com/ericgaspar/) who designed our new logo!  
Have a look at our new website (which also explains the reasoning behind the renaming) at https://hedgedoc.org  

This is probably the last release in the 1.x series. Stay tuned for 2.0, scheduled for release next year.

**Please note:** This release dropped support for Node 8, which is end-of-life since January 2020. You now need at least Node 10.13 to run HedgeDoc, but we recommend running [the latest LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

**Please note:** If you use a reverse proxy and TLS, make sure it sets the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header correctly,
otherwise you will encounter login-issues.
[Our docs](https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/blob/72734690225bb431908b0d4bd8edf38576a95f2f/docs/setup/reverse-proxy.md#reverse-proxy-config) have example configs for common reverse proxies.
