title: How stable is the demo instance?

In the past, the number of problems with our demo instance was very low, but **we don’t guarantee that your notes won’t be lost** because of hardware or software malfunctions.
The demo instance runs the latest unstable code from our repository, so sometimes things might not work as expected.
We generally recommend hosting your own instance for more than testing the features.
